	ABSTRACT = {Iron(II) spin crossover molecular materials are made of coordination centres switchable between two states by temperature, pressure or a visible light irradiation. The relevant macroscopic parameter which monitors the magnetic state of a given solid is the high-spin (HS) fraction denoted nHS, i.e., the relative population of HS molecules. Each spin crossover material is distinguished by a transition temperature T1/2 where 50% of active molecules have switched to the low-spin (LS) state. In strongly interacting systems, the thermal spin switching occurs abruptly at T1/2. Applying pressure induces a shift from HS to LS states, which is the direct consequence of the lower volume for the LS molecule. Each material has thus a well defined pressure value P1/2. In both cases the spin state change is easily detectable by optical means thanks to a thermo/piezochromic effect that is often encountered in these materials. In this contribution, we discuss potential use of spin crossover molecular materials as temperature and pressure sensors with optical detection. The ones presenting smooth transitions behaviour, which have not been seriously considered for any application, are spotlighted as potential sensors which should stimulate a large interest on this well investigated class of materials.},

	abstract = {Some 3dn (4 <= n <= 7) transition metal compounds exhibit a cooperative transition between a low-spin (LS) and a high-spin (HS) state. This transition is abrupt and occurs with a thermal hysteresis, which confers a memory effect on the system. The intersite interactions and thus the cooperativity are magnified in polymeric compounds such as [Fe(Rtrz)3]A2{\textperiodcentered}nH2O in which the Fe2+ ions are triply bridged by 4-R-substituted-1,2,4-triazole molecules. Moreover, in these compounds, the spin transition is accompanied by a well-pronounced change of color between violet in the LS state and white in the HS state. The transition temperatures of these materials can be fine tuned, using an approach based on the concept of a molecular alloy. In particular, it is possible to design a compound for which room temperature falls in the middle of the thermal hysteresis loop. These materials have many potential applications, for example, as temperature sensors, as active elements of various types of displays, and in information storage and retrieval.},
